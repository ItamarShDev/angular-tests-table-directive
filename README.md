# Angular Test table directive

###Have you ever needed to create a simple HTML table, to show your tests status?

We all know the next problem:
We have tests running, and we want to show them in a table.
> ***the problems***:
> * not all tests ran in the same dates
> * the number of the dates is ever changing


This directive is plain simple,
just call it with the data, and get the right table HTML
> **this directive hasn't any css properties, its pure ``<table>, <th>, <td>, <tr>`` so you can customize it as you wish.**

### Data format
The directive will parse your data as long as its in the following format:
{
    rowName: [
    {name:"", result:""},
    {name:"", result:""},
    {name:"", result:""},
    {name:"", result:""},
    ...
    ],
    ...
}

- ``rowName`` is the first col of each row
- ` {name:"", result:""}` is a col where
 - ``name`` is the test's name
 - ``result`` is the test's result


### Example

 For the following object:
```javascript
  {Fedora: [
    {name: "dec10", result: "Fail"},
    {name: "dec1", result: "Pass"},
    {name: "dec2", result: "Pass"},
    {name: "dec3", result: "Pass"},
    {name: "dec4", result: "Pass"},
    {name: "dec5", result: "Pass"},
    {name: "dec6", result: "Pass"},
    {name: "dec7", result: "Pass"},
    {name: "dec8", result: "Pass"}],
